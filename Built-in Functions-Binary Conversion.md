# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
x=16
y=bin(x)
print(y)
```
## Output

![438592637-eb21d0cf-f113-4233-b719-2318653f5522](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cec4afd9-b3f9-4b4e-af47-5f09a9d6ab5b)

## Result
Thus the python program is executed successfully
